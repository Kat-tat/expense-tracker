# expense-tracker
## Expense tracker made as part of freeCodeCamp Python course.

I created an expense tracker which displays various options to the user: add an expense, list all expenses, show total expenses, filter expenses by category, exit.
Depending on user input, tracker then performs an appropriate function using a dictionary, lambda functions, map function and filter function.
